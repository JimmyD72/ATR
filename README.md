# ATR (All The Rage!) 
This project is an app for a mobile rage room, and as the company doesn't have a traditional
storefront to engage potential customers. The company needs a portal for customers to read about the services provided,
the ability to register and login to access the services, schedule and reserve a time, send comments, and pay for their
services.
This project was created for a real world business that will tentatively open in Spring of 2023. The original
plan was to open a brick and mortar location, however, location and start-up costs are prohibitive and the new business
model of the room being mobile reduces the financial strain on the company. Having a web presence is key to the
operation and success of "All The Rage!".

The project utilizes JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, SCSS, Bootstrap, Webpack, and more.
